Patternlab to Gemini
====================

I love [atomic design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com) within [patternlab](http://patternlab.io). But in combination with [gemini](https://github.com/gemini-testing/gemini), which provides utility for css regression test it's an awesome workflow for working on large scale projects and especially redesigns.

The idea behind this project is to generate the test cases automatically from the styleguide of patternlab.
