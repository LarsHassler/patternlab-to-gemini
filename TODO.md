##EPICS:
* [x] generate json file with all pattern
* Template for test case structure. maybe http://ejs.co/
* CLI mode
* Publish NPM Package
* Deal with pattern states
* Skipping screen sizes for specific pattern
* Skipping browsers for specific patterns
* Test for molecules and organisms should not run if an included pattern broke
    * get dependency tree out of patternlab
* Improve display of warnings

##USER STORIES: 
* config file should be written

##TODOS:
* [x] save new config



##CONSIDERATIONS:
* [?] move browserSize into npm dependency (or maybe not??)
* [?] Add "Scope" css classes to specific pattern (maybe should be a feature inside patternlab ?)
* [?] error: json files, but does not contain configs
